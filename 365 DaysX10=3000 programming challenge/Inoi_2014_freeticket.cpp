/*
Nikhil’s slogan has won the contest conducted by Drongo Airlines and he is entitled to a
free ticket between any two destinations served by the airline. All cities served by Drongo
Airlines can be reached from each other by some sequence of connecting flights. Nikhil is
allowed to take as many connecting flights as needed, but he must take the cheapest route
between his chosen destinations.
Each direct flight between two cities has a fixed price. All pairs of cities connected by
direct flights have flights in both directions and the price is the same in either direction. The
price for a sequence of connecting flights is the sum of the prices of the direct flights along
the route.
Nikhil has information about the cost of
each direct flight. He would like to maximize the value of his prize, so he would like
to choose a pair of cities on the network for
which the cost of the cheapest route is as high
as possible.
For instance, suppose the network consists
of four cities {1, 2, 3, 4}, connected as shown
on the right.
In this case, Nikhil should choose to travel between 1 and 4, where the cheapest route
has cost 19. You can check that for all other pairs of cities, the cheapest route has a smaller
cost. For instance, notice that though the direct flight from 1 to 3 costs 24, there is a cheaper
route of cost 12 from 1 to 2 to 3.
Input format
• Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, C and F. C is the number of cities on the
network, numbered 1, 2, . . . , C. F is the number of pairs of cities connected by a direct
flight.
• Lines 2 to F + 1 : Each line describes one direct flight between a pair of cities and
consists of three integers, x, y and p, where x and y are the two cities connected by
this flight and p is the price of this flight.
For all direct flights, x 6= y and no pair of cities is connected by more than one direct
flight. If there is a direct flight from x to y with price p, there is also a flight from y
to x with price p and exactly one of these two will be listed.
Output format
The output consists of a single integer, the maximum cost among the cheapest routes between
all pairs of cities across the airline’s network.

Test Data
The testdata is grouped into three subtasks. In all subtasks, 2 = C = 230 and 1 = F =
26335. In addition, each subtask has the following constraints on the inputs.
• Subtask 1 (20 marks) : F = C - 1 (that is, the airline network is a tree) and p = 1 for
each direct flight.
• Subtask 2 (30 marks) : There is no constraint on the shape of the network, but for
each direct flight, p = 1.
• Subtask 3 (50 marks) : There is no constraint on the shape of the network, but for
each direct flight, 0 = p = 105
.

Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above
